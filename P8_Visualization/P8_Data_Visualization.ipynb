That is the main message. Further a reader can see that for childrens (age <= 10) that does not apply as the proportion of sex between saved childrens is roughly equal. Or the people travelling by first class survived in more cases than people travelling by third class."

    "I decided to create a dashboard and split the visualization into 4 plots plus side filter controls. The key characteristics - wheter passenger survived or not - is distinguished by orange/blue colouring and is present in all the plots. Thus I will not mention it in further descriptions. First plot, side-by-side barplot, shows proportion of survived by sex. Proportion is calculated as e.g. female survived/total survived (what proportion of survivors are females) and encoded in the middle of bars as the percentage label. Second plot (righ-top), histogram, simply represents the distribution by age. The third plot, scatter plot, shows age as columns and fare as a rows, where sex is encoded as a shape and detail is on passengerID. The fourth plot, histrogram, represents the distribution by age and class. The dashboard have two actions, highliting activated by hovering and filtering which is activated by selecting (clicking). In the controls part are few possible choices how to change the visualization but also a legends. Reader can use filtering by sex, place of embarkation or sector using multiple list filters. Then is also included filtering by age where the reader can set the maximal age of passengers included in visualization, I really like this small feature.\n",

    "\n",
    "After receiving some feedback, I decided to change one of plots in the dashboard. The third (left-bottom) plot is really small and thus some information value disappears. Instead of the first plot I used side-by-side barplot, showing average fare by sex, where the average fare is encoded in the middle of the bars as a label. Dashboard is now more consistent regarding used types of plots, but also maybe more monotonous, it depends. Then I hid the headers for columns, which are also addressed in the enclosed screenshot. And this was a good point, from my point of view. As I did not realize that the information is already contained in the header of the plot (but again it depends on the reader, this is quite subjective someone do not mind the extra header). And the last change which is from the second person, who was missing the actual number of people by sex in the first plot. The rest remained unchanged."

Those are the crucial informations I tried to remember, but more important is to use those good-habits in the future.\n",
